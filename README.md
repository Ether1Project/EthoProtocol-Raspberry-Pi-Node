## How to run an EthoProtocol Node on a Raspberry-Pi 4 (64bit)

This example is for a GATEWAY NODE.  If you wish to run a Master or Service Node please change the node type in the upgrade command line.  This script swaps out a Geth AMD64 binary for a Geth ARM64 during the install.

**You must install the Etho Node as ROOT user, for some reason on an -Ubuntu Pi- there are permission problems if installed with "ether1node" user.**

###### Step 1
Prepare your Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu (20.04 server recommended) as found on this page:
https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-desktop-on-raspberry-pi-4#1-overview

###### Step 2
Prepare your Raspberry Pi as a Etho Node as found on this page:
https://docs.ethoprotocol.com/nodes/installing-uninstalling-etho-nodes/installing-etho-nodes

###### Step 3
Go to the Etho Protocol Node Dashboard and generate your Node Install script:
https://nodes.ethoprotocol.com

###### Step 4 
Edit the autogenerated script as outlined below for the correct Geth Binaries. 
**Note this will install Etho Protocol Geth Version 2.1.0 64bit ARM** \
The auto genrated install script from the EthoProtocol Node Dashboard will look something like this:

```
mkdir -p /tmp/ethoprotocol && cd /tmp/ethoprotocol
rm -rf upgrade-debian.sh && wget https://nodes.ethoprotocol.com/download/upgrade-debian.sh
chmod +x upgrade-debian.sh
./upgrade-debian.sh -n 'gatewaynode' -u 'cdbd1320bab64184d8022af65fe9da92df21a81d' -w '0XAFF4A8AFB0CE10057DD2534C1CF34D016DF96E11'

```
And swap out the wget and upgrade.sh lines so your command looks like the one below.  Of course keep YOUR unique node ID and wallet address (those are the long characters/numbers in quotes). 

```
mkdir -p /tmp/ethoprotocol && cd /tmp/ethoprotocol
rm -rf etho-pi-upgrade-debian.sh && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashratez/EthoProtocol-Raspberry-Pi-Node/main/etho-pi-upgrade-debian.sh
chmod +x etho-pi-upgrade-debian.sh
./etho-pi-upgrade-debian.sh -n 'gatewaynode' -u 'cdbd1320bab64184d8022af65fe9da92df21a81d' -w '0XAFF4A8AFB0CE10057DD2534C1CF34D016DF96E11'
```
**Run your updated command on your PI to install the Etho Node.**
After a couple of minutes run this command to make sure your node is running correctly:
```
sudo systemctl status ether1node
```
